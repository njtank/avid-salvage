# **Avid-Salvage**  
**Version:** 1.0.0  

## **Overview**  
Avid-Salvage is a FiveM script that allows players to take on a salvage job where they scrap cars at designated zones. This script uses **ox_inventory**, **ox_lib**, and **ox_target** for smooth functionality and a user-friendly experience.  

Players will:  
- Interact with a ped to start the job.  
- Complete "Scrap Car" tasks at configurable zones using animations and progress bars.  
- Earn $50 upon completing 14 tasks and receive random salvageable items during each task.

## **Features**  
- **Customizable Ped**: Easily configure the ped's model and location.  
- **Interactive Zones**: Players can perform tasks at multiple configurable salvage zones.  
- **Reward System**: Players earn cash and items ("plastic," "scrapmetal," and "rubber") for their work.  
- **Integrated Animations**: Uses the `mini@repair:fixing_a_ped` animation with a progress bar.  
- **Dependencies**: Built to integrate seamlessly with **ox_inventory**, **ox_lib**, and **ox_target**.
